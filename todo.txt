Note: cm is codemirror

[  ] increase size of bottom padding to see if search bug (search and item found is behind the terminal) is circumvented
[  ] python interface to draw on a js canvas (but how to replicate in an IDE? matplotlib?)
[  ] no tag in markup (outside blocks) means <p>
[  ] replace time id with incrementing (to avoid having to commit new ids to git all the time)
[  ] non-greedy regex to replace backticked code with <code></code>
[  ] remove "ter√° que instalar python from cap3 because thonny does not need it

[OK] generate table of contents dynamically
[OK] create pseudo markup with single lines becoming <p>, replacing " & " with &amp; " < " with &lt; " > " with &gt;. Placing #py by itself in a line marks the beginning of a textarea block, and the block ends with #endpy. The textarea should have an id of "filename_n" where n is an integer counter. Add a button to evaluate the textarea given the same id.
[OK] favicon.ico
[OK] padding for cm editor
[OK] see if now that pages are static, the cm settimeout can be removed
